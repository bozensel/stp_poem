I think that I shall never see
A graph more lovely than a tree.
A tree whose crucial property
Is loop-free connectivity.
A tree that do be sure to span
Do packets can reach every LAN.
First, the root must be selected.
By ID, that is elected.

Least cost paths from root are traced.

In the tree, these paths are placed.
A mesh is made by folks like me,
Then bridges find a spanning tree.

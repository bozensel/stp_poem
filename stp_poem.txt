I think that I shall never see
hb making some changes.
A graph more lovely than a tree.
A tree whose crucial property
Is loop-free connectivity.
another change happened.
A tree that must be sure to span
So packets can reach every LAN.
First, the root must be selected.
one more changes.
By ID, it is elected.
Least cost paths from root are traced.
COTM added for test. 
In the tree, these paths are placed.
A mesh is made by folks like me,
So find a spanning.
Another line with test. 
Then bridges find a spanning tree.
